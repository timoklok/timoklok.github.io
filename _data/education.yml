    The Piet Zwart Instute was an eye-opener: Taking control of your own production process by taking a deep dive into code and developing an understanding of the digital landscape in a historic, artistic and theoretic sense. The course focussed heavily on the importance of the open-source community. Got some attention when this materialized in a browser plugin linking The Pirate Bay to Amazon.com (one party wasn't happy).

    The two years resulted in a interactive installation that investigated the possibility of database-driven narration. Okay, it was actually a video-piece that created and endless James Bond movie mashup, ask me about it sometimes...

    4 year course in animation and motion graphic design, in which I often collaborated in multidisciplinary AV-projects and got to work for real clients such as the VARA, Crossing Border Festival and Peter Greenaway. Graduated with a video installation combined with a research into the (artistic) theory of the sublime in relation to video-art.
