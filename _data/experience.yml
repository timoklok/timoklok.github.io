    The VPRO is the most foreward thinking public broadcaster of The Netherlands, and I am very proud to be part of the Innovation and Digital Media team. As a frontender I get to develop and maintain various platforms such as [VPRO.nl](https://www.vpro.nl) and [3voor12](https://www.3voor12.nl). Besides, we produce one-off projects such as 14-18, [Door het Hart van China](https://china.op.vpro.nl/), or [Onzichtbaar Nederland](https://waarisdit.vpro.nl/) and develop apps for specific programs such as [Trees](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/trees-luister-en-reageer/id1328390003).

    I'm also currently the product owner for 3voor12, facilitate hackathons, and participate in Google Design Sprints.

    As a jack-of-all-trades I supported the Media Design & Communication (@ Piet Zwart Instituut, Willem de Kooning Academie, Hogeschool Rotterdam) department in various ways. I was a tutor first and foremost, supporting students in their projects, both technically and conceptually. Besides tutoring, I was repsonsible for the design and development of promotion-material, setting up expositions and various supporting tasks such as managing the student archive and the recording/documentation of live events.
